# Zomato-Customer-Churn-Retention-Analysis
SQL and Tableau analysis of customer behavior on Zomato, uncovering factors that influence churn and retention.
# Introduction:
This project investigates customer churn patterns for Zomato using SQL and Tableau, aiming to uncover drivers behind repeat customer behavior.
Using SQL, I cleaned and joined datasets from users, orders, and restaurants, applying churn logic based on inactivity thresholds. I then visualized churn trends by income, family size, education level, and restaurant region/cuisine.
